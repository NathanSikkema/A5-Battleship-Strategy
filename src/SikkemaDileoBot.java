 Discussion Question 2:
 The single most important strategy we implemented in our Battleship bot was the probability map.
 This approach significantly improved the bot’s accuracy and decision-making during the game.
 (See the table below for the performance difference.)

 The probability map takes into account:
    • Remaining ship sizes
    • Previous hits and misses
    • Valid ship orientations
    • Cells adjacent to confirmed hits

 By factoring all of this in, we were able to build a very effective probability model—one that I think could
 replace all other shot logic on its own and still perform under 100 shots per game on average.

 ==================================================================================
   |         Metric          | Without Probability Map  | With Probability Map  |
   |-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
   | Average Score (Shots)	  | 187.13	                  | 81.32                 |
   | Time for 10,000 games	  | 1,158 ms	                | 3,228 ms              |
 ==================================================================================

 Why the probability map had an impact:
 • Intelligent Shot Selection:  Using statistics to guide each move, it removed the guesswork.
 • Adaptability:                The bot adapted its shooting strategy based on remaining ships and known hits.
 • Coverage Efficiency:         It avoided redundant targeting and minimized wasted shots.
 • Early Detection:             Ships were located faster, which led to earlier transitions into "target" mode (where adjacent cells are checked).
